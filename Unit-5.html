Financially successful designs generate a financial return with can in turn be invested in further research and development, creating new inventions and innovations. Gillet safety razors are a well-known example of invention driven by a desire to make money. Realizing that a disposable razor blade would result in repeat purchases, Gillette developed a system in 1903 whereby the blade was removable from the holder. Over a century later, Gillette continues to innovate around the concept of a removable blade.

                    <li> Digital music players: iPod revolutionized the way people purchased and listened to music. Existing portable music systems (CDs and cassette tapes) we obsolete within a decade. With the advent of iMusic and iTunes, people purchased digital versions of music and listen to it in a different - some would argue that iTunes killed the album, as most people list to just songs.</li>
                    <li>Web-based video / Video on Demand: Netflix, Hulu, and other Video On Demand (VOD) services change the way consumers watch video. We can now watch what we want, when we want. We can watch entire seasons in one sitting, if we want to. Traditional cable providers have had to change their pricing models, the types of shows they offer, and to even begin offering VOD options.</li>

As companies have the most control over this type of innovation, it is one of the most common types.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>There are many examples of process innovation. Henry Ford developed the modern assembly line which enabled Ford Motor Company to offer affordable cars to the masses.

If parts are no longer available, the product can no longer work in the way it originally did. Also, if a service vital to its functioning is no longer available, it can become obsolete.For example, a computer can become functionally obsolete if you can no longer run the latest operating system, or its architecture can no longer support new memory modules.</p>
